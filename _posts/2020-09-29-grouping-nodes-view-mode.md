In this tutorial, I will show you technique on how we can group the nodes based on the taxonomy term, even when we were using a content format instead of fields for individual rows. In other words, you can maintain your custom display mode as the output format for the rows but use the value of a field on your content type to group the rows around it and even display this value as a heading for the groups.
