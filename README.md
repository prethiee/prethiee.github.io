# About me

Hi :raising_hand_woman:

I’m Preethi and go by `prethiee` as my SNS handle. I’m a PHP/Drupal Developer at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/)

I created this page to keep track of the tech-stack I learnt and worked with all along in my career. Even though I mostly work with the backend but always was keen on exploring other aspects of the web.

I aim to create stuff that makes the user experience easier and enjoyable at the same time loving what I do.
